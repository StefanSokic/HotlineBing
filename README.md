#HotlineBing

The Hackathon
-------------
Won "most technically complicated" award at terribleHack Vancouver. The goal of the hackathon is to create a useless/annoying but technically challenging project.
The Project
-------------
Microsoft recently acquired LinkedIn for 26 billion. I thought I should make something that Microsoft would acquire after this hackathon.
What it does
-------------
Every new tab a user opens goes to bing.com. Every search they make in the search bar goes through bing.com. Every time a user tires to access one of google's 186 domains they get redirected to bing.com.
